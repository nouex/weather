* request params (branch created)
  * option to select °C or °F (must reflect requestParams.units)
  * let user select location (time machine request). google maps iframe

  that gives us the coordinates of the chosen location?

### Refactoring:

* localTime is only used by <Header />, cut the overhead by making it a
state property of <Header />
* cleanup components/DataBlockCard.js
* rename state.localTime -> state.freshTime
* inline TODOs
* seperation of concerns: e.g. components/Refresh.js now has a lil more action.
  Maybe put all handler stuff in decorators/Loading.js to keep components/*
  strictly presentation-wise
